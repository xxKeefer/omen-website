The [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) function of an `Array` is one of the most versatile functions in JavaScript. With it you can accomplish a lot of the functions from the [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and [Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) objects. It's job is to start with an array, and reduce those elements into some other type of data... which sounds vague, but you could use it to convert from an array to an object, an array to another array, an array to a number or an array to a boolean. Understanding how it works opens up a world of possibilities.
