# A Story driven RPG

Omen is a story driven RPG inspired by DnD, Fate and other games in the genre. It has been developed by Ben Gorman and his friends to enable a story first experience at the game table.

Omen tries to avoid that **"Yeah, but the rules don't let you do that."** experience often found in table top RPG's. Omen is setting agnostic so it let's you tell whatever story you like.

Once Players and DM's wrap there head around the core concept of <InlineDefine term='verisimilitude'/> or _Narrative Permission_, your stories will never be more fluid, action packed or immersive than when they are told using Omen.
